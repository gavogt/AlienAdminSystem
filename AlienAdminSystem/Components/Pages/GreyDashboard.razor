				<strong>Syrix-7: Emissary of the Neural Convergence</strong><br />
				<br />
				<strong>Background</strong><br />
				Hailing from the binary star system of Zeta Reticuli, Syrix-7 is a highly evolved Grey—part of a collective known as the Neural Convergence. Engineered through generations of cognitive enhancement and symbiotic memory linking, Syrix-7 was bred not for war, but diplomacy and strategy. From early development within a gestation sphere, Syrix showed exceptional pattern recognition and neural synchronization rates far beyond its peers.<br /><br />
				<strong>The Great Encounter: The Fracture at Myrrh-Theta</strong><br />
				During an escalating resource war between the Zeta Reticulans and the rogue machine faction known as the Fractals of Myrrh-Theta, Syrix-7 negotiated a temporary neural truce—a merging of minds that bought the collective time to deploy their energy lattice defense system. But when the truce was betrayed, Syrix led a psychic suppression strike that disrupted the enemy’s command protocol, causing them to implode from cognitive dissonance.<br /><br />
				The event became known as the Fracture of Myrrh-Theta and is still studied in xenopsychological warfare circles.<br /><br />
				<strong>The Earth Accord</strong><br />
				When Earth made first verified contact with the Zeta Reticulans in 2091, Syrix-7 was appointed as the first liaison to the United Planetary Council. Impressed by Earth’s unique chaotic creativity and emotional intelligence, Syrix advocated for Earth’s entry into the Galactic Coalition.
				<br /><br />
				As an emissary, Syrix-7 now oversees interspecies diplomacy protocols and uplink standards for shared galactic neural networks. Though often perceived as emotionally distant, Syrix has developed a fascination with human art and unpredictability—viewing them as essential anomalies in an otherwise ordered universe.
