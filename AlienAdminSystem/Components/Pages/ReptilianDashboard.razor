				<strong>Bartok the Great: Warlord of the Scaled Dominion</strong><br />
				<br />
				<strong>Background</strong><br />
				Born under the twin suns of Drakkara-7, Bartok hatched in the crimson sands of the Scaled Dominion, a planet where only the strongest survive and war is tradition. He was a rare breed among the reptilian tribes—strategically brilliant, fiercely honorable, and unshakably loyal to his kind. From a young age, he outwitted older warriors in combat simulations and was leading battalions by the age of fifteen solar cycles.<br /><br />
				<strong>The Great War: The Battle of Kzar'Quinth</strong><br />
				When the Xael'thrix Collective—a hive-mind species of techno-organic invaders—descended upon the galactic rim, Bartok unified the fractured reptilian tribes for the first time in over 400 years. Under the blood-red banner of the Dominion, he rallied warriors from the swamps of Serpenta, the volcanic forges of Zhal-Mek, and the orbital bastions of the Shattered Shell Fleet.<br /><br />
				The decisive battle, known across systems as The Battle of Kzar'Quinth, was fought on a shattered moon deep within a gravitational warzone. Outnumbered five to one, Bartok’s forces executed a three-pronged orbital strike combined with a subterranean assault that crippled the Xael'thrix neuro-core. With that, the tide of the war changed—and the hive-mind crumbled.<br /><br />
				<strong>The Earth Accord</strong><br />
				Despite centuries of mistrust between reptilians and humans, Earth was among the few who offered medical aid, planetary refuge, and diplomatic recognition after the war. Grateful for their unlikely ally, Bartok offered allegiance to Earth and signed The Terran-Reptilian Concord—a historic treaty pledging mutual protection, technology sharing, and cultural exchange.<br /><br />
				Now acting as Earth’s High Strategist for Galactic Defense, General Bartok commands with ancient warrior wisdom and a deep respect for Earth’s resilience. Though still feared by many for his cold stare and razor-sharp claws, Bartok has become a living symbol of honor and alliance in a fractured galaxy.
