				<strong>Dr. Elian Voss: Human Anomaly from the 43rd Parallel Future</strong><br />
				<br />
				<strong>Background</strong><br />
				Dr. Elian Voss was born on a terraformed exoplanet known as Novus Gaia—a colony established by a breakaway faction of Earth scientists in the late 2900s. Unlike most inhabitants of his time, Elian displayed a unique neural signature that allowed him to perceive nonlinear time threads. At the age of 12, he accidentally activated an ancient time vault, propelling him into a fractured multiverse of temporal echoes.<br /><br />
				Guided by interdimensional mentors and armed with a temporal interface device fused to his nervous system, Elian eventually learned to navigate the timelines—not just observing, but altering and harmonizing them. His theories on quantum causality and paradox syncing remain foundational in chrono-science academies across four star systems.<br /><br />
				<strong>The Chrono Conflict: Echo Wars of Loop-12</strong><br />
				During a cataclysmic event known as the Loop-12 Cascade, multiple realities began collapsing due to overlapping time threads initiated by rogue chrono-pirates. Elian led a task force of paradox stabilizers to reset anchor points across collapsing dimensions. In a final act of brilliance, he entered a recursive timestream and convinced a past version of himself to never activate the vault—restoring stability at great personal cost.<br /><br />
				<strong>The Earth Reconnection</strong><br />
				Though considered a myth on modern Earth, Elian reappeared in 2142 to assist in building Earth’s Temporal Science Division. He established protocols for ethical time travel, founded the Chrono-Harmonic Institute, and currently serves as Lead Temporal Architect.
				<br /><br />
				Though he appears human, Elian’s biology has subtly evolved due to chronal exposure. He is known for cryptic predictions, paradoxical speech patterns, and a deep affection for 21st-century jazz. Despite operating on a different temporal frequency, he remains Earth’s most trusted voice on timeline integrity.
